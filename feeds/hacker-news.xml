                    &lt;p&gt;If this had been available in 2010, Redis scripting would have been JavaScript and not Lua. Lua was chosen based on the implementation requirements, not on the language ones... (small, fast, ANSI-C). I appreciate certain ideas in Lua, and people love it, but I was never able to &lt;i&gt;like&lt;/i&gt; Lua, because it departs from a more Algol-like syntax and semantics without good reasons, for my taste. This creates friction for newcomers. I love friction when it opens new useful ideas and abstractions that are worth it, if you learn SmallTalk or FORTH and for some time you are lost, it&amp;#x27;s part of how the languages are different. But I think for Lua this is not true enough: it feels like it departs from what people know without good reasons.&lt;/p&gt;

                    &lt;p&gt;The company he&amp;#x27;s worked for nearly a quarter century has enabled &amp;amp; driven more consumerist spend in all areas of the economy via behaviorally targeted optimized ad delivery, driving far more resources and power consumption by orders of magnitude compared to the projected increases of data centers over the coming years. This level of vitriol seems both misdirected and practically obtuse in lacking awareness of the part his work has played in far, far, far more expansive resource expenditure in service to work far less promising for overall advancement, in ad tech and algorithmic exploitation of human psychology for prolonged media engagement.&lt;/p&gt;

                    &lt;p&gt;My dad was a busy construction contractor. One summer he tore himself away from work and took the family to a week long boat camp out next to a big beautiful lake. It turned out that our campsite was actually in the lake by a few inches at high water, but dad saw a way to dam it off and keep it dry, so he grabs the shovel and starts digging trenches and building walls and ordering us around.&lt;p&gt;About an hour into that, pouring sweat, he stops cold and says &amp;quot;what the hell am I doing?&amp;quot; The flooded camp was actually nice on a hot day and all we really had to do was move a couple of tents. He dropped the shovel and spent the rest of the week sunbathing, fishing, snorkeling and water skiing as God intended. He flipped a switch and went from Hyde to Jekyll on vacation. I&amp;#x27;ve had to emulate that a few times.&lt;/p&gt;
                    &lt;/blockquote&gt;

                    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; The way Faulkner treats his characters, I treat domain name projects. I buy them with an intention to develop. And I let them take the lead. They’re the inspiration for the business itself. They guide me towards what they need to become. I’m just the dude behind the keyboard (sorta).&lt;p&gt;I feel the same way about personal projects and blogs. A good idea tends to be self-reinforcing. It just needs someone to uncover it. Selling onions on the internet seems unusual but to the right person that idea is gold.&lt;/p&gt;

                    &lt;p&gt;With every passing year the New Yorker stands out even more. High quality long-form journalism and short fiction with minimal advertising (in the print issue it’s just a few at the front and one at the back) is very hard to find. I love getting my issue in the mail every week and I’ve never once thought that reading it was a waste of my time.&lt;p&gt;I’d highly encourage anyone who loves great writing to subscribe.&lt;/p&gt;

                    &lt;p&gt;This seems like a tragedy of the commons -- GitHub is free after all, and it has all of these great properties, so why not? -- but this kind of decision making occurs whenever externalities are present.&lt;p&gt;My favorite hill to die on (externality) is user time.  Most software houses spend so much time focusing on how expensive engineering time is that they neglect user time.  Software houses optimize for feature delivery and not user interaction time.  Yet if I spent one hour making my app one second faster for my million users, I can save 277 user hour per year. But since user hours are an externality, such optimization never gets done.&lt;p&gt;Externalities lead to users downloading extra gigabytes of data (wasted time) and waiting for software, all of which is waste that the developer isn&amp;#x27;t responsible for and doesn&amp;#x27;t care about.&lt;/p&gt;
                    &lt;/blockquote&gt;

                    &lt;p&gt;I&amp;#x27;m a T1 diabetic, have worked on open source diabetes-tech (OpenAPS), and have used a number of different CGMs (though not this one specifically). This story... does not make very much sense.&lt;p&gt;CGMs (of any brand) are not, and have never been, reliable in the way that this story implies that people want them to be reliable. The physical biology of CGMs makes that sort of reliability infeasible. Where T1s are concerned, patient education has always included the need to check with fingerstick readings sometimes, and to be aware of mismatches between sensor readings and how you&amp;#x27;re feeling. If a brand of CGMs have an issue that sometimes causes false low readings, then fixing it if it&amp;#x27;s fixable is great, but that sort of thing was very much expected, and it doesn&amp;#x27;t seem reasonable to blame it for deaths. Moreover, there are two directions in which readings can be inaccurate (false low, false high) with very asymmetric risk profiles, and the report says that the errors were in the less-dangerous direction.&lt;p&gt;The FDA announcement doesn&amp;#x27;t say much about what the actual issue was, but given that it was linked to particular production batches, my bet is that it was a chemistry QC fail in one of the reagents used in the sensor wire. That&amp;#x27;s not something FOSS would be able to solve because it&amp;#x27;s not a software thing at all.&lt;/p&gt;
                    &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Open the link on a computer, host a session, scan the QR code with your phone(s) and play!&lt;p&gt;What is it?&lt;p&gt;Gaming Couch is a party game platform where friends play short competitive action games together on one screen, using their phones as controllers (there&amp;#x27;s also support for physical gamepads if that&amp;#x27;s more your thing!)&lt;p&gt;I intentionally avoided trivia and text-heavy games. Many people don’t write or read English fluently, and I wanted games where reaction, timing, and chaos matter more than spelling.&lt;p&gt;It’s currently in early public access with 18 mini-games, all made by me and a two friends. All game rounds last ~1 minute, scores carry over, and after each round players vote on the next game. If you’re solo, 3 games support bots, but it’s best with a full couch of people as half the fun comes from the social aspect of playing together!&lt;p&gt;Why I built it:&lt;p&gt;For the last 15+ plus years, me and my friends have loved video game nights but organizing them has always been a PITA when you have more than 4 people playing:&lt;p&gt;- Different games were under different Steam accounts requiring downloads and installation.&lt;p&gt;- Extra controllers were missing (somebody forgot to bring theirs) or they wouldn’t pair.&lt;p&gt;- Consoles were expensive and not always available if we were on the road.&lt;p&gt;Once I started building it, other dev friends asked if they could make games for it too, which led me to realize this could also be a platform for small party games, especially for gamejam devs who don’t want to or have time to build multiplayer infrastructure from scratch. This is why supporting third-party games is the next major feature I’m working on.&lt;p&gt;Tech stack:&lt;p&gt;- Games run locally in the host’s browser (no streaming of games)&lt;p&gt;- Phones connect via WebRTC to the host session (1–10ms latency in ideal conditions with P2P connection)&lt;p&gt;- Fallback to TURN when direct P2P connection isn’t possible e.g. due to strict firewall settings in corporate networks or use of VPN&amp;#x27;s&lt;p&gt;- Website&amp;#x2F;Platform made with React + TypeScript&lt;p&gt;- Existing games made with Unity or just plain JS&amp;#x2F;TS.&lt;p&gt;- Backend: Supabase (Postgres + auth only, currently only used for optional user accounts)&lt;p&gt;How is it different from e.g. Jackbox, Airconsole or Nintendo?&lt;p&gt;Jackbox is absolutely great, but it’s heavily dependent on English literacy and &amp;quot;being funny&amp;quot; on the spot. I wanted something focused on fast, chaotic, real-time action games that work even if your friends speak different languages or just want to smash buttons. Also, I&amp;#x27;m not a fan of their party pack model...&lt;p&gt;AirConsole is the most well known comparison to Gaming Couch in terms of technology and execution, but I feel there is a gap for a curated experience where the UI is unified, rounds are 60 seconds, and the competitive &amp;quot;meta-game&amp;quot; (scoreboards&amp;#x2F;voting) is baked into the platform. And in any case AirConsole was acquired by a car-software company and have pivoted their focus from couch gaming toward in-car entertainment.&lt;p&gt;Nintendo games are usually the gold standard in the party game category but the HW and games cost so much! With Gaming Couch, I want to keep the accessibility threshold as low as possible so everyone is able to play without upfront HW or SW costs.&lt;p&gt;What do you think of this? Are you an interested player or perhaps a developer who has had an idea to develop a fun 8 player mini-game but has been daunted by the idea thus far?&lt;/p&gt;

                    &lt;p&gt;Hey! I played your game with my friends last weekend! We get together every month to play board games, and lately we&amp;#x27;ve been doing a lot of party games like Jackbox or King of the Castle. One of our guys had heard about your game and we gave it a go and we ended up playing it for most of the day!&lt;p&gt;We tried most of the game options and had really great fun with all of it. Everything worked fine, no issues, no desync, and it didn&amp;#x27;t destroy battery life on the phone controllers either. I&amp;#x27;d say the ferry race and the parking games were my favourite overall, but the others aren&amp;#x27;t bad by any means! So, thanks a lot for your work, and I&amp;#x27;ll definitely be returning to Gaming Couch with my group!&lt;p&gt;And for a question: Do you have plans to monetize the platform in the future?

                    &lt;p&gt;I&amp;#x27;ll never get people who say that there is too much politics at a god damn hacker conference like the CCC, considering The Chaos Computer Club was founded in 1981 specifically to be a political watchdog.&lt;p&gt;more so especially since the very act of &amp;quot;hacking&amp;quot; is a political statement because it involves redistributing power over information.&lt;p&gt;Code is law, remember?&lt;p&gt;That would be like complaining about &amp;quot;too much law&amp;quot; at a constitutional convention.&lt;/p&gt;

                    &lt;p&gt;Asahi is awesome!
But this is also proves that laptops outside the MacBook realm really need to improve so much. I wish there were a Linux machine with the hardware quality of a MacBook&lt;/p&gt;

                    &lt;p&gt;The really special thing about Frameworks is that you can quickly buy and replace basically any part, not just the usual RAM and SSD -- case in point, when I managed to damage my FW13&amp;#x27;s keyboard such that it was no longer usable, I could just... go straight to Framework&amp;#x27;s website and buy a new one for $40. And, I even had the option of a slightly improved one, that shed the Windows key and lacked the god-awful copilot key.&lt;p&gt;This approach even allows the manufacturer to correct design flaws after the fact -- and let&amp;#x27;s face it, there will always be design flaws. For instance, my FW13 originally came with a very weak hinge for the screen. It was perfectly usable for most daily usage and most people probably wouldn&amp;#x27;t care, but it meant I couldn&amp;#x27;t hold it up without the screen tilting back. Well, FW corrected this for those customers who really did care by just selling a new hinge for $24, and so $24 + 10 minutes with a screwdriver later, I had a substantially more refined device! (And to clarify -- there was a defective hinge version in the early batches, and those were replaced free of charge. Mine was a slightly later version that, beyond lacking the level of stiffness I preferred, was not defective.)&lt;/p&gt;
                    &lt;/blockquote&gt;

                    &lt;p&gt;I&amp;#x27;ve played with this a bit and it&amp;#x27;s ok. I&amp;#x27;d place it somewhere around sonnet 4.5 level, probably below. But with this aggressive pricing you can just run 3 copies to do the same thing, choose the one that succeeded and still come out way ahead with the cost. Not as great as following instructions as Claude models and can get lost, but still &amp;quot;good enough&amp;quot;.&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#x27;m very happy with using it to just &amp;quot;do things&amp;quot;. When doing in depth debugging or a massive plan is needed, I&amp;#x27;d go with something better, but later going through the motions? It works.&lt;/p&gt;

Punting it to 2026. I&amp;#x27;m thinking to get the Samsung Galaxy XR and experiment with some VR apps and learn the fundamentals of spatial computing. As an Android mobile developer, that feels like a natural extension.&lt;p&gt;- Complete the &amp;quot;UCSanDiegoX: Computer Graphics II: Rendering&amp;quot; computer graphics course. I did the first course in the series and found it enlightening (no pun intended)&lt;p&gt;- Create an e2e project that earns money as a side gig. It&amp;#x27;s time to put my product and technical knowledge to practice and actually build something people want.&lt;p&gt;- Leverage AI across all my endeavors. AI tools are here to stay and the more I know how to use them effectively, the better. The speed boost in learning a new framework&amp;#x2F;concept is phenomenal.&lt;p&gt;Non-technical skills:&lt;p&gt;- Expand my social circle - the unstable tech climate made me realize the importance of maintaining a healthy social network. My goal is to connect with more people both inside my company and outside, by both proactively reaching out and going to meetups in my area. In fact, I invite fellow NYC-based HN-ers to contact me at cybercreampuff at yahoo dot com, in case you want to meet up!&lt;/p&gt;

                    &lt;p&gt;This is a new years resolution question barely in disguise, but they&amp;#x27;re fun cause a lot of us are cooped up, barely 4 days into winter, 86ish to go, and we&amp;#x27;re champing at the bit for change.&lt;p&gt;I am pretty sure I&amp;#x27;m a 50th percentiler. I&amp;#x27;m mid 40s, kinda burned out but still struggling forward in my ok-but-not-hollywood IT career, I still have a passion for doing things well in a technical society that values doing things cheap (and well). The things I am known for being good at, I still google daily, and for a long time, I&amp;#x27;ve been hungry for a change - any change - but especially one that isn&amp;#x27;t chaotically negative.&lt;p&gt;So in 2026, I wanna learn how dirt works.&lt;p&gt;I actually have a giant box of dirt sitting on a shelf at the UNH community co-op soil analysis lab, waiting to give me some kind of data about the soil behind my house. (Or is it dirt? I don&amp;#x27;t know what I&amp;#x27;m getting into).&lt;p&gt;In 2024 I tried growing some corn. It never sprouted.&lt;p&gt;In 2025 I tried growing some corn. It sprouted and a few ears had enough kernels to make one full mouthful. Tasty, but maybe 7 calories of food for a year of effort.&lt;p&gt;So in 2026 I&amp;#x27;d like to grow: one entire fully formed ear of sweet corn. Anything else is a bonus.&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#x27;s what I wanna develop in 2026 - learning how soil works enough to make it make a thing.  Small moves, Ellie.&lt;/p&gt;

                    &lt;p&gt;I have what I thought was a broad knowledge base of rust an experience in it over many domains, but I haven&amp;#x27;t heard of most of those. Have been getting by with `&amp;amp;`, and `&amp;amp;mut` only from those tables!&lt;p&gt;Incidentally, I think this is one of Rust&amp;#x27;s best features, and I sorely miss it in Python, JS and other languages. They keep me guessing whether a function will mutate the parent structure, or a local copy in those languages!&lt;p&gt;Incidentally, I recently posted in another thread here how I just discovered the &amp;#x27;named loop&amp;#x2F;scope feature, and how I thought it was great, but took a while to discover. A reply was along the effect of &amp;quot;That&amp;#x27;s not new; it&amp;#x27;s a common feature&amp;quot;. Maybe I don&amp;#x27;t really know rust, but a dialect of it...&lt;/p&gt;
                    &lt;/blockquote&gt;

                    &lt;p&gt;I wanted to share a quick piece of feedback from a potential reader&amp;#x27;s perspective: There are several small inconsistencies in the intro text (e.g., inconsistent capitalization of &amp;#x27;Rust&amp;#x27; vs &amp;#x27;rust&amp;#x27;, grammar typos).&lt;p&gt;In a domain like OS development where extreme precision is required, these small errors can subconsciously signal to readers that the technical details might also be imprecise. A quick polish of the documentation would go a long way in establishing authority and trust for the rest of the book.&lt;/p&gt;
                    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
