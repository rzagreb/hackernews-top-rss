My name&amp;#x27;s Luke and I made the original Jmail here alongside Riley Walz. We had a ton of friends collaborate on building out more of the app suite last night in lieue of DOJ&amp;#x27;s &amp;quot;Epstein files&amp;quot; release.&lt;p&gt;Please AMA!&lt;/p&gt;

                    &lt;p&gt;I&amp;#x27;m impressed. You guys cloned a whole suite of products in a short period of time that cost millions of dollars. Even the little bits of humor look costly.&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, it&amp;#x27;s way more information than I expected. I can see why someone would hesitate to release them - there&amp;#x27;s a lot to sift through and it&amp;#x27;s likely even the government couldn&amp;#x27;t sift through all of them to make sure their friends weren&amp;#x27;t mentioned somewhere.&lt;/p&gt;

                    &lt;p&gt;I once commented on HN how my favorite Sci Fi novel is &lt;i&gt;Accelerando&lt;/i&gt; and the author, Charles Stross, replied to it suggesting I try his &lt;i&gt;The Rapture of the Nerds&lt;/i&gt; he co-wrote with Cory Doctorow; I loved it when I read it too.&lt;p&gt;I love HN - it&amp;#x27;s basically the only website I visit these days (aside checking mail, watching YouTube, and gardening my GitHub repositories).&lt;/p&gt;

                    &lt;p&gt;The cost analysis here is solid, but it misses the latency and context window trade-offs that matter in practice. I&amp;#x27;ve been running Qwen2.5-Coder locally for the past month and the real bottleneck isn&amp;#x27;t cost - it&amp;#x27;s the iteration speed. Claude&amp;#x27;s 200k context window with instant responses lets me paste entire codebases and get architectural advice. Local models with 32k context force me to be more surgical about what I include.&lt;p&gt;That said, the privacy argument is compelling for commercial projects. Running inference locally means no training data concerns, no rate limits during critical debugging sessions, and no dependency on external API uptime. We&amp;#x27;re building Prysm (analytics SaaS) and considered local models for our AI features, but the accuracy gap on complex multi-step reasoning was too large. We ended up with a hybrid: GPT-4o-mini for simple queries, GPT-4 for analysis, and potentially local models for PII-sensitive data processing.&lt;p&gt;The TCO calculation should also factor in GPU depreciation and electricity costs. A 4090 pulling 450W at $0.15&amp;#x2F;kWh for 8 hours&amp;#x2F;day is ~$200&amp;#x2F;year just in power, plus ~$1600 amortized over 3 years. That&amp;#x27;s $733&amp;#x2F;year before you even start inferencing. You need to be spending $61+&amp;#x2F;month on Claude to break even, and that&amp;#x27;s assuming local performance is equivalent.&lt;/p&gt;
                    &lt;/blockquote&gt;

                    &lt;p&gt;I looked into this a little because I was curious. I guess the ostensible &amp;quot;national security&amp;quot; rationale (which clearly is not the only reason!) for this is that turbines severely degrade the utility of radar surveillance along the coastlines.&lt;p&gt;This is particularly relevant for low-altitude incursions and drones.&lt;p&gt;Now, other large governments (UK) have resolved this in several ways, including the deployment of additional radars on and within the turbine farms themselves.&lt;p&gt;So clearly this is politically motivated, and they&amp;#x27;re using what seems to be a real but solveable concern as a scapegoat.&lt;/p&gt;

                    &lt;p&gt;My favorite lens on this comes from Hamming:&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; It is well known the drunken sailor whos taggers to the left or right n independent random steps will, on the average, end up about sqrt(n) steps from the origin. But if there is a pretty girl in one direction, then his steps will tend to go in that direction and he will go a distance proportional to n. In a lifetime of many, many independent choices, small and large, a career with a vision will get you a distance proportional to n, while no vision will get you only the distance sqrt(n). In a sense, the main difference between those who go far and those who do not is some people have a vision and others do not and therefore can only react to the current events as they happen.&lt;p&gt;Just a tiny bit of bias towards a direction will get you very far very fast.&lt;p&gt;I once modeled+visualised this with a bit of javascript[1] and it&amp;#x27;s quite surprising to see the huge difference from even a tiny multiplication factor on each random&amp;#x2F;probabilistic decision.&lt;p&gt;[1] &lt;a href="https:&amp;#x2F;&amp;#x2F;swizec.com&amp;#x2F;blog&amp;#x2F;your-career-needs-a-vision&amp;#x2F;" rel="nofollow"&gt;https:&amp;#x2F;&amp;#x2F;swizec.com&amp;#x2F;blog&amp;#x2F;your-career-needs-a-vision&amp;#x2F;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

                    &lt;p&gt;The post is mainly just a CTA against further internet centralization and government control of core infrastructure, which is fine. We need more of these, and we need more examples of their harms for folks to draw on.  HN often gets distilled down to a singular cause - EU&amp;#x27;s Chat Control, Elon&amp;#x27;s shutdown of Starlink over Ukraine, a regional outage of a public cloud provider - but generalized topics like these aren&amp;#x27;t really discussed all too often I find, or are often flagged for a variety of reasons and shutdown.&lt;p&gt;As technologists of multiple stripes and disciplines - programmers, developers, engineers, architects, designers, product managers, etcetera - we need to collaborate more on the direction of our industry as a whole, rather than just specific niches we find appealing.  From my specific perspective in IT, the increasing centralization across every vendor category (three major x86 server manufacturers, two CPU vendors, two GPU makers, three global-scale public clouds, ISP mono- and duopolies, a handful of commercial operating systems, a near-monopoly EUVL supplier - the list goes on) is a dire threat to not just the open internet, but open technology in general.&lt;p&gt;We need to be better advocates for and champions of the technological future we envision, rather than just blindly celebrate startups and tech fads all the time. Mr. Schneier is merely the latest and largest canary in the proverbial coal mine.&lt;/p&gt;

                    &lt;p&gt;I was driving across the east side of SF and hit a patch of lights that were out.&lt;p&gt;The Waymo&amp;#x27;s were just going really slow through the intersection. It seemed that the &amp;quot;light is out means 4-way stop&amp;quot; dynamic caused them to go into ultra-timid mode. And of course the human drivers did the typical slow and roll, with decent interleaving.&lt;p&gt;The result was that each Waymo took about 4x as long to get through the intersections. I saw one Waymo get bluffed out of its driving slot by cross traffic for perhaps 8 slots.&lt;p&gt;This was coupled with the fact that the Waymos seemed to all be following the same route. I saw a line of about a dozen trying to turn left, which is the trickiest thing to navigate.&lt;p&gt;And of course I saw one driver get pissed off and drive around a Waymo that was advancing slowly, with the predictable result that the Waymo stopped and lost three more slots through the intersection.&lt;p&gt;On normal days, Waymos are much better at the 4-way stops than they used to be a few years back, by which I mean they are no longer dangerously timid. The Zoox (Amazon) cars are more like the Waymos used to be.&lt;p&gt;I expect there will be some software tweaks that will improve this situation, both routing around self-induced congestion and reading and crossing streets with dead lights.&lt;p&gt;Note that I didn&amp;#x27;t see any actually dead Waymos as others have reported here. I believe this is an extreme failsafe mode, and perhaps related to just too much weirdness for the software to handle.&lt;p&gt;It would be interesting to see the internal post mortem.&lt;/p&gt;
                    &lt;/blockquote&gt;

                    &lt;p&gt;When the UK handed back HK, the Chinese who are nothing if not wiley, understood that they needed to maintain intelligence, surveillance, and some kind of institutional knowledge of the various organised crime groups, certain individuals with borderline business interests, that sort of thing. They offered the British police officers houses, stipends, and other incentives to stick around and clue-in the incoming crop of officials, domestic intelligence officers, and cutouts&amp;#x2F;go-betweens. Something of an untold story. Would make a great streaming series.&lt;/p&gt;

                    &lt;p&gt;Was fortunate to talk to a security lead who built the data-driven policing network for a major American city that was an early adopter. ALPR vendors like Flock either heavily augment and&amp;#x2F;or anchor the tech setups.&lt;p&gt;What was notable to me is the following, and it’s why I think a career spent on either security researching, or going to law school and suing, these vendors into the ground over 20 years would be the ultimate act of civil service:&lt;p&gt;1. It’s not just Flock cams. It’s the data eng into these networks - 18 wheeler feed cams, flock cams, retail user nest cams, traffic cams, ISP data sales&lt;p&gt;2. All in one hub, all searchable by your local PD and also the local PD across state lines who doesn’t like your abortion&amp;#x2F;marijuana&amp;#x2F;gun&amp;#x2F;whatever laws, and relying on:&lt;p&gt;3. The PD to setup and maintain proper RBAC in a nationwide surveillance network that is 100%, for sure, no doubt about it (wait how did that Texas cop track the abortion into Indiana&amp;#x2F;Illinois…?), configured for least privilege.&lt;p&gt;4. Or if the PD doesn’t want flock in town, they reinstall cameras against the ruling (Illinois iirc?) or just say “we have the feeds for the DoT cameras in&amp;#x2F;out of town and the truckers through town so might as well have control over it, PD!”&lt;p&gt;Layer the above with the current trend in the US, and 2025 model Nissan uploading stop-by-stop geolocation and telematics to cloud (then, sold into flock? Does even knowing for sure if it does or doesn’t even matter?)&lt;p&gt;Very bad line of companies. Again all is from primary sources who helped implement it over the years. If you spend enough time at cybersecurity conferences you’ll meet people with these jobs.&lt;/p&gt;

                    &lt;p&gt;I really can&amp;#x27;t understand why JetBrains hasn&amp;#x27;t integrated its refactoring tools into the AI system. Really missed the boat on making their platform transformational for AI coding. Imagine how much smaller the context would be for a tool that renames a function than editing hundreds of files. This LSP support is a good start but without the mutation functions it is still pretty lackluster. Plus LSPs aren&amp;#x27;t as good as JetBrains generally.&lt;/p&gt;
                    &lt;/blockquote&gt;

                    &lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Memory Safe
No garbage collector, no manual memory management. A work in progress, though.&amp;quot;&lt;p&gt;I wish them the best, but until they have a better story here I&amp;#x27;m not particularly interested.&lt;p&gt;Much of the complexity in Rust vs simplicity in Go really does come down to this part of the design space.&lt;p&gt;Rust has only succeeded in making a Memory Safe Language without garbage collection via significant complexity (that was a trade-off). No one really knows a sane way to do it otherwise, unless you also want to drop the general-purpose systems programming language requirement.&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#x27;ll be Very Interested if they find a new unexplored point in the design space, but at the moment I remain skeptical.&lt;p&gt;Folks like to mention Ada. In my understanding, Ada is not memory safe by contemporary definitions. So, this requires relaxing the definition. Zig goes in this direction: &amp;quot;let&amp;#x27;s make it as safe as possible without being an absolutist&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

                    &lt;p&gt;I read this article back when I was learning the basics of transformers; the visualizations were really helpful. Although in retrospect knowing how a transformer works wasn&amp;#x27;t very useful at all in my day job &lt;i&gt;applying&lt;/i&gt; LLMs, except as a sort of deep background for reassurance that I had some idea of how the big black box producing the tokens was put together, and to give me the mathematical basis for things like context size limitations etc.&lt;p&gt;I would strongly caution anyone who thinks that they will be able to understand or explain LLM &lt;i&gt;behavior&lt;/i&gt; better by studying the architecture closely. That is a trap. Big SotA models these days exhibit so much nontrivial emergent phenomena (in part due to the massive application of reinforcement learning techniques) that give them capabilities very few people expected to &lt;i&gt;ever&lt;/i&gt; see when this architecture first arrived. Most of us confidently claimed even back in 2023 that, based on LLM architecture and training algorithms, LLMs would never be able to perform well on novel coding or mathematics tasks. We were wrong. That points towards some caution and humility about using network architecture alone to reason about how LLMs work and what they can do. You&amp;#x27;d really need to be able to poke at the weights inside a big SotA model to even begin to answer those kinds of questions, but unfortunately that&amp;#x27;s only really possible if you&amp;#x27;re a &amp;quot;mechanistic interpretability&amp;quot; researcher at one of the major labs.&lt;p&gt;Regardless, this is a nice article, and this stuff is worth learning because it&amp;#x27;s interesting for its own sake! Right now I&amp;#x27;m actually spending some vacation time implementing a transformer in PyTorch just to refresh my memory of it all. It&amp;#x27;s a lot of fun! If anyone else wants to get started with that I would highly recommend Sebastian Raschka&amp;#x27;s book and youtube videos as way into the subject: &lt;a href="https:&amp;#x2F;&amp;#x2F;github.com&amp;#x2F;rasbt&amp;#x2F;LLMs-from-scratch" rel="nofollow"&gt;https:&amp;#x2F;&amp;#x2F;github.com&amp;#x2F;rasbt&amp;#x2F;LLMs-from-scratch&lt;/a&gt; .&lt;p&gt;Has anyone read TFA author Jay Alammar&amp;#x27;s book (published Oct 2024) and would they recommend it for a more up-to-date picture?&lt;/p&gt;

                    &lt;p&gt;My quickie: MoE model heavily optimized for coding agents, complex reasoning, and tool use. 358B&amp;#x2F;32B active. vLLM&amp;#x2F;SGLang only supported on the main branch of these engines, not the stable releases. Supports tool calling in OpenAI-style format. Multilingual English&amp;#x2F;Chinese primary. Context window: 200k. Claims Claude 3.5 Sonnet&amp;#x2F;GPT-5 level performance. 716GB in FP16, probably ca 220GB for Q4_K_M.&lt;p&gt;My most important takeaway is that, in theory, I could get a &amp;quot;relatively&amp;quot; cheap Mac Studio and run this locally, and get usable coding assistance without being dependent on any of the large LLM providers. Maybe utilizing Kimik2 in addition. I like that open-weight models are nipping at the feet of the proprietary models.&lt;/p&gt;

                    &lt;p&gt;As the models have progressively improved (able to handle more complex code bases, longer files, etc) I’ve started using this simple framework on repeat which seems to work pretty well at one shorting complex fixes or new features.&lt;p&gt;[Research] ask the agent to explain current functionality as a way to load the right files into context.&lt;p&gt;[Plan] ask the agent to brainstorm the best practices way to implement a new feature or refactor. Brainstorm seems to be a keyword that triggers a better questioning loop for the agent. Ask it to write a detailed implementation plan to an md file.&lt;p&gt;[clear] completely clear the context of the agent —- better results than just compacting the conversation.&lt;p&gt;[execute plan] ask the agent to review the specific plan again, sometimes it will ask additional questions which repeats the planning phase again. This loads only the plan into context and then have it implement the plan.&lt;p&gt;[review &amp;amp; test] clear the context again and ask it to review the plan to make sure everything was implemented. This is where I add any unit or integration tests if needed. Also run test suites, type checks, lint, etc.&lt;p&gt;With this loop I’ve often had it run for 20-30 minutes straight and end up with usable results. It’s become a game of context management and creating a solid testing feedback loop instead of trying to purely one-shot issues.&lt;/p&gt;

                    &lt;p&gt;There is some nuance to this. Adding comments to the stated goal &lt;i&gt;&amp;quot;Everyone who interacts with Debian source code  (1) should be able to do so (2) entirely in git&lt;/i&gt;:&lt;p&gt;(1) &lt;i&gt;should be able&lt;/i&gt; does not imply &lt;i&gt;must&lt;/i&gt;, people are free to continue to use whatever tools they see fit&lt;p&gt;(2) Most of Debian work is of course already git-based, via Salsa [1], Debian&amp;#x27;s self-hosted GitLab instance. This is more about &lt;i&gt;what&lt;/i&gt; is stored in git, how it relates to a source package (= what .debs are built from). For example, currently most Debian git repositories base their work in &amp;quot;pristine-tar&amp;quot; branches built from upstream tarball releases, rather than using upstream branches directly.&lt;p&gt;[1]: &lt;a href="https:&amp;#x2F;&amp;#x2F;salsa.debian.org" rel="nofollow"&gt;https:&amp;#x2F;&amp;#x2F;salsa.debian.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

                    &lt;p&gt;These are all over the place in Norway (as are they everywhere else, presumably!)&lt;p&gt;When we moved to the island we currently live on, our address was in a road called &amp;#x27;Solsteinen&amp;#x27; (The Sun Stone), but I didn&amp;#x27;t think anything of it until I realized that the roughly hewn stone serving as the property limit marker was juuu-uuust touched by the sun on Winter Solstice. Aha.&lt;p&gt;A quick call to the local archaeologist confirmed my suspicion - &amp;#x27;Oh, so you&amp;#x27;re the new resident there, I&amp;#x27;d planned on being in touch - that stone monument has been there for more than 2000 years, is A-listed and please, whatever you do, don&amp;#x27;t do anything with it. Seriously.&amp;#x27;&lt;/p&gt;

                    &lt;p&gt;Just to talk about a different direction here for a second:&lt;p&gt;Something that I find to be a frustrating side effect of malware issues like this is that it seems to result in well-intentioned security teams locking down the data in apps.&lt;p&gt;The justification is quite plausible -- in this case WhatsApp messages were being stolen! But the thing is... that if this isn&amp;#x27;t what they steal they&amp;#x27;ll steal something else.&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile locking down those apps so the only apps with a certain signature can read from your WhatsApp means that if you want to back up your messages or read them for any legitimate purpose you&amp;#x27;re now SOL, or reliant on a usually slow, non-automatable UI-only flow.&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#x27;m glad that modern computers are more secure than they have been, but I think that defense in depth by locking down everything and creating more silos is a problem of its own.&lt;/p&gt;
                    &lt;/blockquote&gt;

                    &lt;p&gt;I really feel this bit:&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; With agentic coding, part of what makes the models work today is knowing the mistakes. If you steer it back to an earlier state, you want the tool to remember what went wrong. There is, for lack of a better word, value in failures. As humans we might also benefit from knowing the paths that did not lead us anywhere, but for machines this is critical information. You notice this when you are trying to compress the conversation history. Discarding the paths that led you astray means that the model will try the same mistakes again.&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#x27;ve been trying to find the best ways to record and publish my coding agent sessions so I can link to them in commit messages, because increasingly the work I do IS those agent sessions.&lt;p&gt;Claude Code defaults to expiring those records after 30 days! Here&amp;#x27;s how to turn that off: &lt;a href="https:&amp;#x2F;&amp;#x2F;simonwillison.net&amp;#x2F;2025&amp;#x2F;Oct&amp;#x2F;22&amp;#x2F;claude-code-logs&amp;#x2F;" rel="nofollow"&gt;https:&amp;#x2F;&amp;#x2F;simonwillison.net&amp;#x2F;2025&amp;#x2F;Oct&amp;#x2F;22&amp;#x2F;claude-code-logs&amp;#x2F;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;I share most of my coding agent sessions through copying and pasting my terminal session like this: &lt;a href="https:&amp;#x2F;&amp;#x2F;gistpreview.github.io&amp;#x2F;?9b48fd3f8b99a204ba2180af785c89d2" rel="nofollow"&gt;https:&amp;#x2F;&amp;#x2F;gistpreview.github.io&amp;#x2F;?9b48fd3f8b99a204ba2180af785c8...&lt;/a&gt; - via this tool: &lt;a href="https:&amp;#x2F;&amp;#x2F;simonwillison.net&amp;#x2F;2025&amp;#x2F;Oct&amp;#x2F;23&amp;#x2F;claude-code-for-web-video&amp;#x2F;#the-result" rel="nofollow"&gt;https:&amp;#x2F;&amp;#x2F;simonwillison.net&amp;#x2F;2025&amp;#x2F;Oct&amp;#x2F;23&amp;#x2F;claude-code-for-web-vi...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recently been building new timeline sharing tools that render the session logs directly - here&amp;#x27;s my Codex CLI one (showing the transcript from when I built it): &lt;a href="https:&amp;#x2F;&amp;#x2F;tools.simonwillison.net&amp;#x2F;codex-timeline?url=https%3A%2F%2Fgist.githubusercontent.com%2Fsimonw%2Fb9bc2cc5b5d996de3f7383796180276c%2Fraw%2Fb9af382e14bf5ab19aad3d23d4d788dbeef54aa1%2Ftimeline.jsonl#tz=local&amp;amp;q=&amp;amp;type=all&amp;amp;payload=all&amp;amp;role=all&amp;amp;hide=1&amp;amp;truncate=1" rel="nofollow"&gt;https:&amp;#x2F;&amp;#x2F;tools.simonwillison.net&amp;#x2F;codex-timeline?url=https%3A%...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;And my similar tool for Claude Code: &lt;a href="https:&amp;#x2F;&amp;#x2F;tools.simonwillison.net&amp;#x2F;claude-code-timeline?url=https:&amp;#x2F;&amp;#x2F;gist.githubusercontent.com&amp;#x2F;simonw&amp;#x2F;3b2dc0fbea4ba8e677bf6195bc8d9952&amp;#x2F;raw&amp;#x2F;85d69ad9f1b874c2139a2f61c7b0f18ed30856c4&amp;#x2F;4e485649-3221-4d7b-bf1a-129dff975689.jsonl#tz=local&amp;amp;q=&amp;amp;type=all&amp;amp;ct=all&amp;amp;role=all&amp;amp;hide=0&amp;amp;truncate=1&amp;amp;sel=3" rel="nofollow"&gt;https:&amp;#x2F;&amp;#x2F;tools.simonwillison.net&amp;#x2F;claude-code-timeline?url=htt...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;What I really want it first class support for this from the coding agent tools themselves. Give me a &amp;quot;share a link to this session&amp;quot; button!&lt;/p&gt;
